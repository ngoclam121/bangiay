= Importance of WooCommerce Wishlists Plugin =

While strolling around a shopping mall or street you must have seen things that you wished to buy so badly but couldn't because you were short of money or something else. What do you do then? You make a mental note to yourself to remind you to buy it later. But if you are visiting an online shopping store you have a better way to deal with it by creating wishlists; an option to add to wishlist

If you own a WordPress / WooCommerce store, a WooCommerce Wishlist Plugin can easily enable the wishlist feature for you. It does a lot more than just creating a list. Even though wishlist appears to be a feature that helps customers to purchase comfortably, it helps the store owner much more than that.


**Benefits of the wishlist for store**

* Manage stock - Wishlists helps the store admin anticipate the stock level.
* To promote an item - The data about who is saving, the wishlist item, area helps to promote an item which in turn helps in sales of that particular item.
* Customize marketing campaign - Data derived from wishlists help customize your marketing campaign in order to promote a certain product or to appeal to a certain group of individuals in a particular area.
* Fewer returns - Wishlists include products that the customers really want ie; they gave enough time over the decision to purchase the product by putting it on the wishlist. Thus returns will be very less compared to an instant purchase.
* Increases sale - Persuading potential customers to purchase by providing discounts and offers on the items of their wishlist will increase the sales revenue.
* Wishlist is the best way to know your customer's likes and dislikes and keep them attracted to your store forever. Therefore timely analysis of wishlists and putting those conclusions to develop marketing strategies will help a long way in the growth of your business.
